              <h1>Ancient Origins</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
              <p>The beginnings of Halloween date back 2,000 years, to the festival of Samhain, celebrated by the Celts who occupied Ireland, the United Kingdom, and northern France during that time. The festival was celebrated on October 31 and celebrated the new year, which began on the first day of November. The Celts believed that during the night before the new year, the worlds of the living and the dead became blurred, and the ghosts of the dead returned to earth.</p>

              <p>The festivities included sacred bonfires, prophecies by Celtic priests, animal and crop sacrifices, and relighting their hearth fire, in order to protect them during the upcoming winter.</p>

              <p>After the Celts were conquered by the Roman Empire in 43 A.D., the Celtic traditions combined with the Roman, one of which being Feralia, a holiday in October that honored the passing of the dead.</p>

              <h1>All Saint's Day</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
              <p>In the ancient Roman Catholic church, the festival of All Martyrs Day was moved to November 1 and expanded to include all saints, as well as martyrs. This holiday soon blended with Celtic traditions as Christianity expanded into Celtic lands.</p>

              <p>The church would later make November 2 All Souls Day, a celebration honoring the dead. Many believe that this holiday was an attempt to replace the Celtic tradition of Samhain with a church-sanctioned celebration.</p>

              <p>All Souls Day was celebrated similarly to Samhain, with bonfires and people dressing as saints, angels, or devils. All Souls Day was also called All-hallows or All-hallowmass, which eventually transformed into Halloween!</p>

              <h1>Halloween in America</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
              <p>In colonial America, especially in New England, the celebration of Halloween was limited, due to prevailing protestant beliefs. It was more popular in the south.</p>

              <p>Beliefs and customs of different european ethnic groups, as well as native americans, began to blend to create a uniquely American celebration of Halloween. Festivities included public events where people would celebrate the harvest, tell ghost stories, tell fortunes, and partake in mischief-making.</p>

              <p>In the second half of the nineteenth century, new immigrants, specifically the millions that came from Ireland, helped to popularize the holiday.</p>

              <h1>Trick or Treating</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
              <p>The tradition of trick or treating stemmed from a combination of English and Irish customs, which included dressing up and going door to door asking for food or money.</p>

              <p>In the late 1800s, Halloween began to transform into a community celebration that focused on parties and costumes, instead of witchcraft, ghosts, and mischief. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Halloween had lost most of its religious and superstitious association.

              <h1>Jack-o-Lanterns</h1>
            </div>
            <div class="text">
              <p>Jack-o-lanterns originated in Ireland and were based off of the legend of a man named Stingy Jack. The legend goes that Stingy Jack did not want to go to hell, so he trapped the devil in order to make a deal with him. However, he later found out that he did not belong in heaven, due to his devilish nature. So, he was forced to walk the earth as a ghost for all of eternity. The devil gifted Jack some burning coal, which he put in a carved out turnip to light his way.</p>

              <p>Locals began using other gourds, including pumpkins, to carve faces into, as to ward off evil spirits, and thus began the tradition of the jack-o-lantern.</p>
